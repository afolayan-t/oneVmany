# Best Strategies in repeated oneVmany games: Dead by Daylight


## Abstract



## Code

_**Breakdown**_

Our code consists of three python files,

       - player_classses: Consists of the Survivor and Killer object classes
       - game: Consists of the DBD game object class
       - simulation: Runs many simulations of the DBD game on different player strategies and records data to be analyzed
       
 _**Running Games**_
 
 To run the games, you just need to run the simulation file with python3,
 
 ```
 $ python3 simulation.py
 ```
 
 This will cause the script to start printing game information regarding what kind of players are playing the current game, and what was the final outcome was. Data regarding the different strategies' scores and number of wins is recorded across all games and plotted. 
 
 Note the code for the plots is only in the DBD.ipynb (jupyter notebook) file as it tends to display plots more elegantly than just running the code through terminal.
